Title: Scalable identification of spatially variable genes in 
    spatially-resolved transcriptomics data
Description: Method for scalable identification of spatially variable genes 
    (SVGs) in spatially-resolved transcriptomics data. The method is based on 
    nearest-neighbor Gaussian processes and uses the BRISC algorithm for model 
    fitting and parameter estimation. Allows identification and ranking of SVGs 
    with flexible length scales across a tissue slide or within spatial domains 
    defined by covariates. Scales linearly with the number of spatial locations 
    and can be applied to datasets containing thousands or more spatial 
    locations.
